Implementation of AVL Tree and BST written by Jonathan Luetze

Purpose of Implementation is to compare runtimes between AVL and Binary Search Trees

Overview of the files in this repository:

1. main.c - main file
2. BinarySearchTree.c - BST methods
3. avlt.c - AVL Tree methods
4. queue.c - Queue methods that are used for the Level-Order Traversal

Commands:
- To create the exectuable, execute the command "make"
- To execute the graph files, execute the command "make test"
  To execute the individual files, run:  ./trees [-b or -a for BST or AVL] [wordfile] [commandfile]
- To clean up the files, execute the command "make clean"
